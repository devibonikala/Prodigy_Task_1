# Data Visualization Script

## Overview

This script performs data visualization on a CSV file using Python's `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries. It generates two types of plots:

1. **Histogram**: Displays the distribution of values from a specific row in the CSV file.
2. **Bar Chart**: Shows the distribution of population across different age groups from specific rows in the CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `matplotlib` library

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
## File Paths
Ensure your CSV file is located at /home/rguktong/Desktop/2101e6d6-1ebe-47fc-bb17-9d64aff35ed8_Data.csv. Update the path in the script if necessary.

## Script Details
**1. Import Libraries**
First, import the required libraries:
```bash
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
**2. Load Data**
Load the CSV file into a DataFrame:
```bash
df = pd.read_csv('/home/rguktong/Desktop/2101e6d6-1ebe-47fc-bb17-9d64aff35ed8_Data.csv')
```
**3. Histogram**
Generate a histogram to visualize the distribution of values from a specific row in the DataFrame. Note that this approach is unconventional; histograms are typically created from entire columns of data.

```bash
data = df.iloc[14]  # Selecting the 15th row of data
print(data)
plt.figure(figsize=(25, 10))
plt.hist(data, bins=30, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Histogram of Example Data')
plt.show()
```
**4. Bar Chart**
Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of population across different age groups. The script selects the 16th row for both gender and population data. Ensure that these selections are appropriate for your dataset.
```bash
gender = df.iloc[15]  # Selecting the 16th row for gender
population = df.iloc[15]  # Selecting the 16th row for population

plt.figure(figsize=(20, 15))
plt.bar(gender, population, color='green')
plt.xlabel('Age Groups')
plt.ylabel('Population')
plt.title('Population Distribution by Age Groups')
plt.show()
```
## Troubleshooting
**File Not Found Error:** Verify that the CSV file exists at the specified path. Ensure the path is correct and accessible.
**Column Not Found or Plot Issues:** Make sure the data selected from the rows matches the intended visualization. Check for correct column names and data types in your CSV file.
